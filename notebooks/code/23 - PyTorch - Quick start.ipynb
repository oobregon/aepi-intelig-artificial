En todos los ejemplos hasta ahora, hemos estado realizando operaciones por asignación. Es decir, hemos estado asignando una variable al resultado de una operación, o simplemente imprimiéndola en la salida, como en el ejemplo anterior. En cualquier caso, la variable original permanece intacta. Alternativamente, es posible que necesitemos aplicar una operación *in place*. Podemos, por supuesto, asignar una variable a sí misma, como en x = x.transpose(0,1). Sin embargo, una forma más conveniente de hacer esto es con operaciones *in place*. En general, las operaciones *in place* en PyTorch tienen un guión bajo al final. A continuación se muestra un ejemplo:"
